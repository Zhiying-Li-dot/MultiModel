                   generation, usually integrating text and image conditioning
                   to enhance control over the generated content. Despite the
                   progress, ensuring consistency across frames remains a
                   challenge, particularly when using text prompts as control
                   conditions. To address this problem, we introduce UniCtrl, a
                   novel, plug-and-play method that is universally applicable
                   to improve the spatiotemporal consistency and motion
                   diversity of videos generated by text-to-video models
                   without additional training. UniCtrl ensures semantic
                   consistency across different frames through cross-frame
                   self-attention control, and meanwhile, enhances the motion
                   quality and spatiotemporal consistency through motion
                   injection and spatiotemporal synchronization. Our
                   experimental results demonstrate UniCtrl's efficacy in

               requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this
               paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on
               the strong use of data augmentation to use the available
               annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of
               a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding
               path that enables precise localization. We show that such a
               network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and
               outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window
               convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of
               neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the
               same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images
               (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge
               2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the
               network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than
               a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on
               Caffe) and the trained networks are available at

              recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder
              configuration. The best performing models also connect the

              new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on
              attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions
              entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these
              models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable
              and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model
              achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation
              task, improving over the existing best results, including
              ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French

              on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best
              models from the literature. We show that the Transformer
              generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to

  abstract      = "Character Animation aims to generating character videos from
                   still images through driving signals. Currently, diffusion
                   models have become the mainstream in visual generation
                   research, owing to their robust generative capabilities.
                   However, challenges persist in the realm of image-to-video,
                   especially in character animation, where temporally
                   maintaining consistency with detailed information from
                   character remains a formidable problem. In this paper, we
                   leverage the power of diffusion models and propose a novel
                   framework tailored for character animation. To preserve
                   consistency of intricate appearance features from reference
                   image, we design ReferenceNet to merge detail features via
                   spatial attention. To ensure controllability and continuity,
                   we introduce an efficient pose guider to direct character's
                   movements and employ an effective temporal modeling approach
                   to ensure smooth inter-frame transitions between video
                   frames. By expanding the training data, our approach can
                   animate arbitrary characters, yielding superior results in
                   character animation compared to other image-to-video
                   methods. Furthermore, we evaluate our method on benchmarks
                   for fashion video and human dance synthesis, achieving
                   state-of-the-art results.",
